# Introduction

This gitbook is intended to serve as a playbook for the major competitions that the club does throughout the year, and serve as a consolidated team notebook, so we're not trying to make up new stuff every single event.

Hopefully, we actually make this into something.

**These notes are incomplete, feel free to contribute at anytime.**

## Locally Hosting It
### Obsidian (or any other Markdown editor)
Since everything is in Markdown, you should be able to use any Markdown-based editor. Here's a few options:

- [Obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md/)
- [Trillium](https://github.com/zadam/trilium)
- [Joplin](https://joplinapp.org/)

Just clone the repository and open it in the app of your choice. 

### Honkit
If you want to locally host this as a website, use [Honkit](https://github.com/honkit/honkit).

**Prerequisites:** Node.js, npm, [honkit](https://github.com/honkit/honkit)
```bash
npm install honkit --save-dev
npx honkit serve
```

Should be on `https://localhost:4000` by default.
