# Forensics Resources
> You get good at forensics by having good fundamentals, so a lot of specific resources are just learning specific tools.

## Videos
- [13Cubed](https://www.youtube.com/@13Cubed) the üêê of Volatility and general forensics. I'll be honest, I feel like I learn something new from every single video.
- [John Hammond's Malware Analysis Series](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL1H1sBF1VAKWMn_3QPddayIypbbITTGZv) is arguably the most well-structured malware analysis content on YouTube right now. Brings you from initial motivation to uncovering the main payload with the rabbit holes and everything, while also somehow being streamlines. Good stuff.
- [Ji≈ô√≠ Vinopal](https://www.youtube.com/@DuMpGuYTrIcKsTeR)'s YouTube channel is basically a masterclass in .NET reversing.

## Cheatsheets/Written Resources
- [CyberRaiju HUGE Resource Dump](https://www.jaiminton.com/cheatsheet/DFIR/#)
- [Andrea Fortuna](https://andreafortuna.org/)'s website has so many good cheatsheets and resources for various tools. Almost always shows up when I'm googling something.
- [Trail of Bits](http://trailofbits.github.io/ctf/forensics/) has a good high-level overview of things you can look at, but nothing in specific

## Challenge Labs
- [Blue Team Labs Online](https://blueteamlabs.online/) is like HackTheBox but for defenders. There's definitely some scuff here and there, but nonetheless still has challenges for all levels.
	- They also offer some kind of certification. While it doesn't have industry recognition, I've heard good things.
