# Cryptography Resources
> This section is mainly for the people looking to dive into cryptography and the underlying math, not really for basic concepts like "What is GPG?" or "How do I use OpenSSL?". These questions are valid, but you might just want to hit up Google for that.

## Books
- [Serious Cryptography](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/serious-cryptography/9781492067511/xhtml/cover.xhtml) is a very good book to introduce fundamental concepts
- [An Introduction to Mathematical Cryptography](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-0-387-77993-5) is an intro-level, proofs-based book on some cryptographic concepts. Technically costs $50, but you can always *find* it ;)
- [A Graduate Course in Applied Cryptography](https://toc.cryptobook.us/) is free and should be read after Intro to Mathematical Cryptography

## Challenge Platforms and Others
- [CryptoHack](https://www.cryptohack.org/) is a gamified platform exclusively for cryptography and cryptanalysis. Very, very smart people over in their Discord - 100% recommend this.
- [CryptoPals](https://cryptopals.com/) is a collection of cryptography exercises which are very programming-oriented (e.g. making you write your own frequency analysis, writing a padding oracle attack)
- [MysteryTwisterC3](https://mysterytwister.org/home/) focuses more on crypto design and didactical aspects (like a tutorial in differential cryptanalysis) and it includes many challenges with historic or "obscure" procedures and machines (like HandyCipher or Sigaba).
- [Dan Boneh's Cryptography Course](https://crypto.stanford.edu/~dabo/courses/OnlineCrypto/) is another resource to learn the subject
