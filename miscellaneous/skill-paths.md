# Skill Paths
## Complete Beginner

## Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR)

## System Administration/Hardening

## Application Security (Web-Focus)
### Key Concepts

| Pillars | Skills |
| --- | --- |
| Web Development | Be able to give a high-level overview of web development, design, and architecture. Explain various HTTP requests. Distinguish between front-end and back-end. Knowledge of JavaScript and at least one web development framework is *highly recommended*.  |
| Programming/Code Review/Software Engineering | Have basic knowledge of using or working with SAST and DAST tooling. Articulate some basics of software engineering processes and CI/CD. Comfort with at least one programming language to at least automate certain tasks. |
| OWASP Top 10 (Vulnerabilities) | Understand the OWASP Top 10, and various vulnerability classes associated with each major category. Be able to explain SQL injection, XSS/CSRF, XXE, IDOR, File Inclusion, Unrestricted File Upload, SSRF, Insecure Deserialization at bare minimum.  |
| Tooling | Be able to use a proxy (ex: BurpSuite, OWASP Zap), browser developer tools, and the command line for other open source tooling (ex: `ffuf`, `sqlmap`, `nuclei`, etc) |

### Path
**TODO**

- Web Development + Programming
	- O'Reilly Books
  - Literally just try writing something in Express.js, Flask, etc.
  - Python - https://automatetheboringstuff.com/
- OWASP Top 10 + Vulnerabilities
  - PortSwigger Academy - https://portswigger.net/web-security
  - HackTheBox CBBH Course - https://academy.hackthebox.com/preview/certifications/htb-certified-bug-bounty-hunter ($8 a month with student subscription, don't bother with exam)
- Code Review + Software Engineering
	- OWASP Cheatsheets - https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/index.html
  - Engineering Software as a Service - https://saasbook.info/ (don't need to read the whole book, just skim and get a gist for what they're talking about)
- Tooling
	- See whatever we have for linux command line stuff
